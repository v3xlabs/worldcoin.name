Every person in the world has a unique identity, using [worldcoin.name](https://worldcoin.name/?ref=github) you can get your own ENS-compatible worldname, and secure your identity on-chain.

## ❓ How it works

Worldcoin Name is a decentralized identity system that allows you to get your own worldname, and secure your identity on-chain. It leverages the [WorldID](https://worldcoin.org/world-id) protocol, and the [ENS](https://ens.domains/) domain name system in combination with smart contract logic on [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) to provide a decentralized identity system that requires Proof of Personhood to acquire.
