Every person in the world has a unique identity, using [worldcoin.name](https://worldcoin.name/?ref=github) you can get your own ENS-compatible worldname, and secure your identity on-chain.

## ‚ùì How it works

Worldcoin Name is a decentralized identity system that allows you to get your own worldname, and secure your identity on-chain. It leverages the [WorldID](https://worldcoin.org/world-id) protocol, and the [ENS](https://ens.domains/) domain name system in combination with smart contract logic on [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) to provide a decentralized identity system that requires Proof of Personhood to acquire.

## üìù How to use

| ‚ùó This can only be done once          |
| ---------------------------|

Simply visit [worldcoin.name](https://worldcoin.name/?ref=github) and follow the instructions to get your own worldname. Verify using your [World app](https://worldcoin.org/download-app), and you're done!

If you are not worldcoin verified [find an orb operator near you](https://worldcoin.org), to get verified.

Worldcoin Name was built for the [ETHGlobal ETHTokyo23 hackathon](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/worldname-xuaoy).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è State of the Gateway

At the time of writing it appears we have encountered an unexpected issue with signing on the gateway side. This means that although the solidity contracts have been written correctly and function as expected. The nodejs connecting gateway is unable to verify the signature and therefore returns an error. We are currently working on a fix for this issue.
